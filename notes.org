* SDK

  The SDK appears to be useful.

  We'll need to change what we're requesting from the OAuth dance to the
  =account_id=, assuming that's available.

  See the [[file:spikes/sdk/][SDK Spike]].

  We are assuming that the =account_id= is not a secret and so should be
  logged/kept in the clear.

  Notably the SDK has a pagination iterator. We'll just need to figure out
  the bookmarking strategy for it. Default to writing a bookmark for every
  record?
